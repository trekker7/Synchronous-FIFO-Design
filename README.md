# Synchronous-FIFO-Design
Author Md. Ali. Kamran

In this Project we have designed and verified a synchronous FIFO. It is dual ported RAM based FIFO and supports concurrent
read and write operation.

Full and Empty generation Condition-
Read and Write pointer has width of Log2(FIFO_DEPTH)+1
MSB is used to detect Full and Empty condition
If Read and Write pointer are equal FIFO is Empty
if Read and Write pointerâ€™s MSB differ but rest bit are same FIFO is Full

Pseudorandom Testing-
In Testbench we are applying random stimuli ie enq,deq and din. The Stimuli and Response of RTL model is stored in text file.
A reference model of FIFO is designed in Python. We apply stimuli from text file generated by testbench to reference model and 
compare response of RTL mode and reference model. Any discrepency between response of two is printed.
